#The linkedlist is better in manipulating data- making numerous inserts and
	deletes.
------------Notice, they're very much similar!
#In the other hand, ArrayList is better for storing and accessing data, as it 
	is similar to a normal array.

#HashMaps provide the same functionality as above, but in pairs.

#So how they differ from the HashSet?

#So nice to use, the methods in the Collections Class are static.
	Its sort method can be called on integers as well.

#Each time you invoked the .next method, the iterator advances to the next element
	in the list.
	
#The 'for loop', or most especially, 'the for-each loop' deals with Arrays
as 'while loops' deals with Iterators.

#The constructor of the Scanner class can take a File object as a parameter.

#The final: Final data cannot be changed
			final methods cannot be overridden
			final classes cannot be sub-classed!
